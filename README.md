## **What is a dactyl-manuform?**
[Dactyl-Manuform](https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform) is an open source fork of the famous 3D printed [Dactyl Keyboard](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard) by [Matt Adereth](https://github.com/adereth) 

This keyboard features a split layout where the columns will be staggered instead of the rows. This shape is inspired by the early ergonomic keyboard designs. This layout helps the user rest their arms in a naturally neutral position. [This provides comfort and prevents RSI. ](http://xahlee.info/kbd/i2/split_keyboard__david_Rempel_2008_HF.pdf). 

I assembled this keyboard as a hobby project and for one of my university projects. The steps taken to build this is briefly explained below.
